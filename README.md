ðŸš€ paw is a comprehensive and open source ticket management system designed to streamline issue tracking and resolution processes for organizations. It provides a centralized platform for users to submit, track, and manage tickets or requests, facilitating efficient communication and collaboration among team members.

## Features

- **Ticket Creation and Submission:** Users can create and submit tickets with detailed information about the issue, including title, description, priority, and category and file attachments.

- **Ticket Assignment and Ownership:** Tickets can be assigned to specific individuals or teams responsible for resolution, allowing for clear ownership and accountability.

- **Communication and Collaboration:** Threaded communication enables seamless collaboration among team members, with the ability to add (internal) comments, attachments, and updates to tickets.

- **Security and Access Control:** Secure user authentication, access controls, and audit trails ensure data privacy and compliance with organizational policies and regulations. You can create teams and restrict access of ticket categories to them.
